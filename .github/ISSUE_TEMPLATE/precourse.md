<!--
  your class repository will have hundreds of issues by the end of HYF
  make your issue easy to find:

  - milestone: `precourse`
  - assign: yourself
-->

This issue has checklists for everything you need to prepare before the first day of [Incremental Development](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/incremental-development). You will want to check all these boxes to join the first class! You can find more details on these assignments in the [HYF Precourse](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/precourse) repository. Besides internet searching, you can head over to [the study book](https://hackyourfuture.github.io/study) for some helpful study references.

Don't worry, it's not as intimidating as it looks and we're all here to help each other.

## Organizing Your Computer

You will be working with many files and folders, it's best to start out organized. Here's some suggestions to start off in the right direction:

- [ ] Create a new folder in your `Documents` called something like "/hack-my-future".
- [ ] Inside your new "/hack-my-future", create one folder called "/notes" or something like this
  - You can use this folder to organize your notes in one place
  - Try using Markdown for your notes!
  - Looking to share everything you've learned? You can also push your notes to a Github repo ;)
- [ ] Inside your new "/hack-my-future", create a folder for the Precourse called "/00-precourse" (or something similar)
  - You can use this folder to clone the [Precourse repository](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/precourse), and to store all your Precourse work

When you're done your computer's folders should be organized something like this:

```
-/Documents
  |-/hack-my-future
    |-/00-precourse
    | |-/ice-breaker (your ice-breaker repository)
    | |-/precourse (the cloned module repo)
    | |-/username (your github profile readme repo)
    |
    |-/notes
    |-/username.github.io (your home page repository)
      (store your home page outside of /00-precourse, you will rewrite it a few times)
```

## Projects

For each of these projects you will need to create a new issue using the `project` issue template. To fill out the project issue you will need to paste in the checklists from the main README of the [Precourse repo](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/precourse). This is the standard way you will submit all projects while at HYF.

Once your issue is created you will need to [add it to the _class-projects_ board](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board) in your class repo and check off these boxes:

- [ ] Individual Project issue is created and on the project board
- [ ] Group Project issue is created and on the project board

---

That's it! You've finished all the tasks in this `precourse` issue. Your classmates and coaches can now find your projects on the Class Projects board.

Welcome to HYF :)
