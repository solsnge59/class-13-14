This repository is yours to keep track of what you've covered so far, to get to know each other, to share helpful resources, to practice collaboration workflows, ... to do everything!

Slack is great for chatting but links and good explanations can easily get lost in message history. Think of this repository as your class' forum and home page.

## Typical Week

Throughout the HYF course and your overall career as a programmer, you will _control your own fate_. 35 hours of study is just the bare minimum to get by at HYF, not enough to fully prepare you for your first job.

The more you know and the harder you work, the faster you will find yourself in a career you love.

The more you participate and become part of the HYF community, the more people are going to be willing to help you in return.
